# where the idea for this recipe came from
# v0.1
Who doesn't love eggs? They are a rite-of-passage for cooks and chefs.
Also, I had just finished eating at Alma, a two-star in Lisbon Portugal.
Also, I was talking to my friend Einar and looking for recommendations on how to step up my chef game: he gave me a recipe for bernaise sauce in the whip can.
I started eating eggs more seriously when I started working out and understanding nutrition and the importance of protein. I was trying some simple things at home, with eggs and egg whites and cottage cheese. As I was eating them I thought to myself: "it's a bit boring, what would they do at Alma?" And I asked chat and here we are.
