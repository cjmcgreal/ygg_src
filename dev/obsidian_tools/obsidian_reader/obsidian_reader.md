**Description**
Syncs Hlíðskjálf with Mímisbrunnr. 
Manages relative data formats

**Desirement functionality**
- Check for conditions ->
	- Are there orphans?
	- Are there objects with parents that don't exist
	- Etc
- Some automation -> 
	- Create 'Obsidian links', i.e. clickable links, from machine-readable ids.
	- Move stuff around according to a "filter" -> could point an obsidian "project" to some folder and use this to move stuff into and out of the folder for cleanliness although this functionality may be achievable directly with the filters in obsidian.
	- Update sequence of stuff in a filter, i.e. top item is closed, update the sequence of remaining items by resetting the value of the "sequence" field.
- Utilities -> 
	- filter by property value
	- rename a property across the board
	- bulk edit
	- clear out empty properties (for readability) and/or make sure all notes have standardized properties.
	- Export to a new obsidian folder structure and/or make individual tickets (dedicated class for this?)
