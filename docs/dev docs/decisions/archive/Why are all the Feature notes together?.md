I decided to put all the feature for all the components in one folder so I can view them in Obsidian Projects all together.

It is *possible* to create an Obsidian Project by reading tags and using Dataview to query/filter/aggregate based on Note "Properties", but then the Project is "read-only" and doesn't allow to write back to, and edit, the notes themselves.
