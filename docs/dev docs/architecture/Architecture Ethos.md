# Single link
- I want objects to only be linked in one way, so that I don't end up having to maintain a ton of different link configurations and managing them and deconflicting.
- backup -> if I have smart monitoring on the links, then ok.

**Example**
A User Paint Point is linked to a procedure. 
In different contexts they can be parents of each other, depending on the context.
I only want this linkage to be tracked/traced in one spot.
