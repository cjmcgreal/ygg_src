# Initial Spec Idea

## User's Initial Description
"I want a prototype of a task selection algorithm. I want it to be implemented using python and I want the interface to be a streamlit interface. I want to use csv as my prototype database with one file per each "table". I want to have a table of tasks that I "could" do. I want them to be assigned each to a domain, and have an estimated effort, an estimated value and a priority within the domain. For my solver run, I want to give it the time that I have to allocate as well as my preferences on which domain I want to allocate how much."
